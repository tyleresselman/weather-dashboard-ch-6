# Weather Dashboard - Challenge 6

# Description
This challenge was indeed a challenge for me. Our task was to create a weather dashboard so that a user might be able to search for weather information for a given city and also see that city's five day forecast. The brief stated that we were to make use of server side APIs to capture weather data, render it on our page, and reflect the recent searches in a bar to the side. This resubmission was great practice of the foundational Javascript skills I've been cultivating throughout this bootcamp. Still could use more work, more to come.
